## Task 1: "Guess the Number"
ðŸŽ¯ The program chooses a number between 1 and 10 (you can set it manually for simplicity).
The user must guess the number. The loop continues until the user enters the correct answer.

ðŸ“Œ Rules:

- If the user enters the wrong number â€” print: `"Incorrect, try again!"`
- If the guess is correct â€” print: `"You guessed it! Victory!"`

### Requirements:
- Use `while` and `input()`
- Add an attempt counter (e.g., `attempts = 0`)
- Limit to **5 attempts**
- Give hints: `"higher"` / `"lower"`
- Add an option for the user to **give up**
